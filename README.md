# Sentiment Analysis Bot

This bot operates under my own neural network. By leveraging vectorization, we can turn plaintext into understandable contents, effectively creating an NLP unit.
The neural network categorizes the text into various types, including "toxic", "insult", "threat", and "racist".

If you've downloaded the repository, you can run userInput.py and it'll take a string via the CLI (terminal) before outputting its classifications.
